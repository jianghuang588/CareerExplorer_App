<h2>about us</h2>
a platform for connecting people to the boks they love, bookah aims to remedy
and stress from the book club process. ever want to start, join, or manager a book
club, but can't connect everyone or everything you need? our pages lay out your 
book club's current book, members, and reading history, allowing you to focus on
what really matters -- finishing this month's read before the meeting!
<br><br>
nurturing literary spirits beyond our years, we've always been passionate about
gathering more people around books. although social media has provided a
pantheon of ways for people to connect, the collaborative spirit of book sharing has
been muted. until now. explore local book clubs and manage your readings, so you 
can focus on the people behind the book instead of the screen in front of it.
